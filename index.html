          Cambodia (/kæm'boʊdiə/ i; Khmer: កម្ពុជា; UNGEGN: Kâmpŭchéa),[14]
          officially the Kingdom of Cambodia (Khmer: ព្រះរាជាណាចក្រកម្ពុជា;
          UNGEGN: Preâh Réachéanachâkr Kâmpŭchéa), is a country in Mainland
          Southeast Asia, spanning an area of 181,035 square kilometres (69,898
          square miles), bordered by Thailand to the northwest, Laos to the
          north, Vietnam to the east, and the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest.
          The capital and most populous city is Phnom Penh.

          In 802 AD, Jayavarman II declared himself king, uniting the warring
          Khmer princes of Chenla under the name "Kambuja".[15] This marked the
          beginning of the Khmer Empire. The Indianised kingdom facilitated the
          spread of first Hinduism and then Buddhism to Southeast Asia and
          undertook religious infrastructural projects throughout the region. In
          the fifteenth century, Cambodia experienced a decline of power, and in
          1863, it became a protectorate of France. After a period of Japanese
          occupation during the Second World War, Cambodia gained independence
          in 1953. The Vietnam War extended into the country in 1965 via the Ho
          Chi Minh and Sihanouk trails. A 1970 coup installed the US-aligned
          Khmer Republic, which was overthrown by the Khmer Rouge in 1975. The
          Khmer Rouge ruled the country and carried out the Cambodian genocide
          from 1975 until 1979, when they were ousted in the
          Cambodian–Vietnamese War. The Vietnamese-occupied People's Republic of
          Kampuchea became the de facto government. Following the 1991 Paris
          Peace Accords which formally ended the war with Vietnam, Cambodia was
          governed by a United Nations mission (1992–93). The UN withdrew after
          holding elections in which around 90% of the registered voters cast
          ballots. The 1997 coup d'état consolidated power under Prime Minister
          Hun Sen and the Cambodian People's Party (CPP). While constitutionally
          a multi-party state,[16] CPP dominates the political system and
          dissolved its main opposition party in 2017, making Cambodia a de
          facto one-party state.[17]
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The United Nations designates Cambodia as a least developed
          country.[18] Cambodia is a member of the United Nations, ASEAN, the
          RCEP, the East Asia Summit, the WTO, the Non-Aligned Movement and La
          Francophonie. Cambodia is a dialogue partner of the Shanghai
          Cooperation Organization.[19][20] Agriculture remains the dominant
          economic sector, with growth in textiles, construction, garments, and
          tourism leading to increased foreign investment and international
          trade.[21] Cambodia is considered among the most vulnerable countries
          to climate change.

        <p>
          The Kingdom of Cambodia is the official English name of the country.
          The English Cambodia is an anglicisation of the French Cambodge, which
          in turn is the French transliteration of the Khmer កម្ពុជា (Kâmpŭchéa,
          pronounced [kampuciə]). Kâmpŭchéa is the shortened alternative to the
          country's official name in Khmer ព្រះរាជាណាចក្រកម្ពុជា (Preăh
          Réachéanachâkr Kâmpŭchéa, pronounced [preah riəciənaːcak kampuciə].
          The Khmer endonym កម្ពុជា Kâmpŭchéa derives from the Sanskrit name
          कम्बोजदेश Kambojadeśa, composed of देश Deśa ("land of" or "country
          of") and कम्बोज (Kamboja), referring to the descendants of Kambu (a
          legendary Indian sage from the ancient Indian kingdom of Kamboja).[22]
          The term Cambodia was already in use in Europe as early as 1524, since
          Antonio Pigafetta cites it in his work Relazione del primo viaggio
          intorno al mondo (1524–1525) as Camogia.[23]
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Scholar George Coedes refers to a 10th-century inscription of a
          Cambodian dynastic legend in which the hermit Kambu Swayambhuva and
          the celestial nymph Mera unite and establish the Cambodian Solar royal
          dynasty (Kambu-Mera), that begins with the Chenla ruler Srutavarman
          and his son Sreshthavarman. Coedes suggests that the Kambu Swayambhuva
          legend has its origins in southern India, as a version of the Kanchi
          Pallava dynasty creation myth.[24][25]
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Colloquially, Cambodians refer to their country as either Srok Khmer
          (ស្រុកខ្មែរ Srŏk Khmêr, pronounced [srok kʰmae]; meaning "Land of the
          Khmers"), or the slightly more formal ប្រទេសកម្ពុជា (Prâtés Kâmpŭchéa,
          pronounced [prɑteh kampuciə]; "Country of Kampuchea"). The name
          Cambodia is used most often in the Western world while Kampuchea is
          more widely used in the East.[26][27][28]

          There exists sparse evidence for a Pleistocene human occupation of
          present-day Cambodia, which includes quartz and quartzite pebble tools
          found in terraces along the Mekong River, in Stung Treng and Kratié
          provinces, and in Kampot Province, although their dating is
          unreliable.[29] Some slight archaeological evidence shows communities
          of hunter-gatherers inhabited the region during Holocene: the most
          ancient archaeological discovery site in Cambodia is considered to be
          the cave of Laang Spean, which belongs to the Hoabinhian period.
          Excavations in its lower layers produced a series of radiocarbon dates
          around 6000 BC.[29][30] Upper layers in the same site gave evidence of
          transition to Neolithic, containing the earliest dated earthenware
          ceramics in Cambodia.[31]
        </p>
        <br />
        <img src="img/pre_history.png" alt="pre_history" />
        <p>
          Archaeological records for the period between Holocene and Iron Age
          remain equally limited. A pivotal event in Cambodian prehistory was
          the slow penetration of the first rice farmers from the north, which
          began in the late third millennium BC.[32] The most curious
          prehistoric evidence in Cambodia are the various "circular earthworks"
          discovered in the red soils near Memot and in the adjacent region of
          Vietnam in the latter 1950s. Their function and age are still debated,
          but some of them possibly date from second millennium BC.[33][34]
          Other prehistoric sites of somewhat uncertain date are Samrong Sen
          (not far from the ancient capital of Oudong), where the first
          investigations began in 1875,[35] and Phum Snay, in the northern
          province of Banteay Meanchey.[36]
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Iron was worked by about 500 BC, with supporting evidence coming from
          the Khorat Plateau, in modern-day Thailand. In Cambodia, some Iron Age
          settlements were found beneath Baksei Chamkrong and other Angkorian
          temples while circular earthworks at the site of Lovea a few
          kilometres north-west of Angkor. Burials testify to improvement of
          food availability and trade, and the existence of a social structure
          and labour organization.[37] Different kinds of glass beads recovered
          from several sites across Cambodia, such as the Phum Snay site in the
          northwest and the Prohear site in the southeast, suggest that there
          were two main trading networks at the time. The two networks were
          separated by time and space, which indicate that there was a shift
          from one network to the other at about 2nd–4th century AD, probably
          due to changes in socio-political powers.[37]

          During the 3rd, 4th, and 5th centuries, the Indianised states of Funan
          and its successor, Chenla, coalesced in present-day Cambodia and
          southwestern Vietnam. For more than 2,000 years, what was to become
          Cambodia absorbed influences from India, passing them on to other
          Southeast Asian civilisations that are now Thailand and Laos.[38]
          Little else is known for certain of these polities, however Chinese
          chronicles and tribute records do make mention of them. It is believed
          that the territory of Funan may have held the port known to
          Alexandrian geographer Claudius Ptolemy as "Kattigara". The Chinese
          chronicles suggest that after Jayavarman I of Chenla died around 681,
          turmoil ensued which resulted in the division of the kingdom into Land
          Chenla and Water Chenla which was loosely ruled by weak princes under
          the dominion of Java.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Khmer Empire grew out of these remnants of Chenla, becoming firmly
          established in 802 when Jayavarman II (reigned c. 790 – c. 835)
          declared independence from Java and proclaimed himself a Devaraja. He
          and his followers instituted the cult of the God-king and began a
          series of conquests that formed an empire which flourished in the area
          from the 9th to the 15th centuries.[39] During the rule of Jayavarman
          VIII the Angkor empire was attacked by the Mongol army of Kublai Khan,
          however, the king was able to buy peace.[40] Around the 13th century,
          Theravavada missionaries from Sri Lanka reintroduced Theravada
          Buddhism to Southeast Asia; having sent missionaries previously in
          1190s.[41][42] The religion spread and eventually displaced Hinduism
          and Mahayana Buddhism as the popular religion of Angkor; however it
          was not the official state religion until 1295 when Indravarman III
          took power.[43]
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Khmer Empire was Southeast Asia's largest empire during the 12th
          century. The empire's centre of power was Angkor, where a series of
          capitals were constructed during the empire's zenith. In 2007 an
          international team of researchers using satellite photographs and
          other modern techniques concluded that Angkor had been the largest
          pre-industrial city in the world with an urban sprawl of 2,980 square
          kilometres (1,151 square miles).[44] The city, which could have
          supported a population of up to one million people[45] and Angkor Wat,
          the best known and best-preserved religious temple at the site, still
          serves as a reminder of Cambodia's past as a major regional power. The
          empire, though in decline, remained a significant force in the region
          until its fall in the 15th century.

        <p>
          After a long series of wars with neighbouring kingdoms, Angkor was
          sacked by the Ayutthaya Kingdom and abandoned in 1432 because of
          ecological failure and infrastructure breakdown.[46][47] This led to a
          period of economic, social, and cultural stagnation when the kingdom's
          internal affairs came increasingly under the control of its
          neighbours. By this time, the Khmer penchant for monument building had
          ceased. Older faiths such as Mahayana Buddhism and the Hindu cult of
          the god-king had been supplanted by Theravada Buddhism.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The court moved the capital to Longvek where the kingdom sought to
          regain its glory through maritime trade. The first mention of Cambodia
          in European documents was in 1511 by the Portuguese. Portuguese
          travellers described the city as a place of flourishing wealth and
          foreign trade. Continued wars with Ayutthaya and the Vietnamese
          resulted in the loss of more territory and Longvek being conquered and
          destroyed by King Naresuan the Great of Ayutthaya in 1594. A new Khmer
          capital was established at Oudong south of Longvek in 1618, but its
          monarchs could survive only by entering into what amounted to
          alternating vassal relationships with the Siamese and Vietnamese for
          the next three centuries with only a few short-lived periods of
          relative independence.

        <br />
        <p>
          The hill tribe people in Cambodia were "hunted incessantly and carried
          off as slaves by the Siamese (Thai), the Annamites (Vietnamese), and
          the Cambodians".[48][49]
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In the nineteenth century, a renewed struggle between Siam and Vietnam
          for control of Cambodia resulted in a period when Cambodia became the
          Tây Thành Province of Nguyễn Vietnam, during which Vietnamese
          officials attempted to force the Khmers to adopt Vietnamese customs.
          This led to several rebellions against the Vietnamese and appeals to
          Thailand for assistance. The Siamese–Vietnamese War (1841–1845) ended
          with an agreement to place the country under joint suzerainty. This
          later led to the signing of a treaty for French Protection of Cambodia
          by King Norodom Prohmborirak.

          In 1863, King Norodom, who had been installed by Siam,[50] sought the
          protection of Cambodia from Siam by French rule. In 1867, Rama IV
          signed a treaty with France, renouncing suzerainty over Cambodia in
          exchange for the control of Battambang and Siem Reap provinces which
          officially became part of Siam. The provinces were ceded back to
          Cambodia by a border treaty between France and Siam in 1907.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Cambodia continued as a protectorate of France from 1867 to 1953,
          administered as part of the colony of French Indochina, though
          occupied by the Japanese empire from 1941 to 1945.[51] and briefly
          existing as the puppet state of Kingdom of Kampuchea in mid-1945.
          Between 1874 and 1962, the total population increased from about
          946,000 to 5.7 million.[52] After King Norodom's death in 1904, France
          manipulated the choice of king, and Sisowath, Norodom's brother, was
          placed on the throne. The throne became vacant in 1941 with the death
          of Monivong, Sisowath's son, and France passed over Monivong's son,
          Monireth, feeling he was too independently minded. Instead, Norodom
          Sihanouk, a maternal grandson of King Sisowath was enthroned. The
          French thought young Sihanouk would be easy to control.[51] They were
          wrong, however, and under the reign of King Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia
          gained independence from France on 9 November 1953.[51]

          Cambodia became a constitutional monarchy under King Norodom Sihanouk.
          When French Indochina was given independence, Cambodia lost hope of
          regaining control over the Mekong Delta as it was awarded to
          Vietnam.[citation needed] Formerly part of the Khmer Empire, the area

          decades before.[54] This remains a diplomatic sticking point with over
          one million ethnic Khmers (the Khmer Krom) still living in this
          region. The Khmer Rouge attempted invasions to recover the territory
          which, in part, led to Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia and deposition
          of the Khmer Rouge.

          In 1955, Sihanouk abdicated in favour of his father to participate in
          politics and was elected prime minister. Upon his father's death in
          1960, Sihanouk again became head of state, taking the title of prince.
          As the Vietnam War progressed, Sihanouk adopted an official policy of
          neutrality in the Cold War. Sihanouk allowed the Vietnamese communists
          to use Cambodia as a sanctuary and a supply route for their arms and
          other aid to their armed forces fighting in South Vietnam. This policy
          was perceived as humiliating by many Cambodians. In December 1967
          Washington Post journalist Stanley Karnow was told by Sihanouk that if
          the US wanted to bomb the Vietnamese communist sanctuaries, he would
          not object unless Cambodians were killed.[55]
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The same message was conveyed to US President Johnson's emissary
          Chester Bowles in January 1968.[56] However, in public Sihanouk
          refuted the right of the U.S. to use air strikes in Cambodia, and on
          26 March he said "these criminal attacks must immediately and
          definitively stop". On 28 March a press conference was held and
          Sihanouk appealed to the international media: "I appeal to you to
          publicise abroad this very clear stand of Cambodia—that is, I will, in
          any case, oppose all bombings on Cambodian territory under whatever
          pretext." Nevertheless, the public pleas of Sihanouk were ignored and
          the bombing continued.[57] Members of the government and army became
          resentful of Sihanouk's ruling style as well as his tilt away from the
          United States.

          While visiting Beijing in 1970 Sihanouk was ousted by a military coup
          led by Prime Minister General Lon Nol and Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak.
          US support for the coup remains unproven.[58] However, once the coup
          was completed, the new regime, which immediately demanded that the
          Vietnamese communists leave Cambodia, gained the political support of
          the United States. The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces,
          desperate to retain their sanctuaries and supply lines from North
          Vietnam, immediately launched armed attacks on the new government. The
          king urged his followers to help in overthrowing this government,
          hastening the onset of civil war.[59]

          Soon Khmer Rouge rebels began using him to gain support. However, from
          1970 until early 1972, the Cambodian conflict was largely one between
          the government and army of Cambodia, and the armed forces of North
          Vietnam. As they gained control of Cambodian territory, the Vietnamese
          communists imposed a new political infrastructure, which was
          eventually dominated by the Cambodian communists now referred to as
          the Khmer Rouge.[61] Between 1969 and 1973, Republic of Vietnam and US
          forces bombed Cambodia in an effort to disrupt the Viet Cong and Khmer
          Rouge.

          Documents uncovered from the Soviet archives after 1991 reveal that
          the North Vietnamese attempt to overrun Cambodia in 1970 was launched
          at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge and negotiated by Pol Pot's
          then second in command, Nuon Chea.[62] NVA units overran many
          Cambodian army positions while the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK)
          expanded their small-scale attacks on lines of communication. In
          response to the North Vietnamese invasion, US President Richard Nixon
          announced that US and South Vietnamese ground forces had entered
          Cambodia in a campaign aimed at destroying NVA base areas in Cambodia
          (see Cambodian Incursion).[63] Although a considerable quantity of
          equipment was seized or destroyed by US and South Vietnamese forces,
          containment of North Vietnamese forces proved elusive.

          The Khmer Republic's leadership was plagued by disunity. In 1972, a
          constitution was adopted, a parliament elected, and Lon Nol became
          president. But disunity, the problems of transforming a 30,000-man
          army into a national combat force of more than 200,000 men, and
          spreading corruption weakened the civilian administration and army.
          The Communist insurgency inside Cambodia continued to grow, aided by
          supplies and military support from North Vietnam. Pol Pot and Ieng
          Sary asserted their dominance over the Vietnamese-trained communists,
          many of whom were purged. At the same time, the CPK forces became
          stronger and more independent of their Vietnamese patrons. By 1973,
          the CPK were fighting battles against government forces with little or
          no North Vietnamese troop support, and they controlled nearly 60% of
          Cambodia's territory and 25% of its population. The government made
          three unsuccessful attempts to enter into negotiations with the
          insurgents, but by 1974, the CPK were operating openly as divisions,
          and some of the NVA combat forces had moved into South Vietnam. More
          than 2 million refugees from the war lived in Phnom Penh and other
          cities.

          On New Year's Day 1975, Communist troops launched an offensive which,
          in 117 days of the hardest fighting of the war, led to the collapse of
          the Khmer Republic. Simultaneous attacks around the perimeter of Phnom
          Penh pinned down Republican forces, while other CPK units overran fire
          bases controlling the vital lower Mekong resupply route. A US-funded
          airlift of ammunition and rice ended when Congress refused additional
          aid for Cambodia. The Lon Nol government in Phnom Penh surrendered on
          17 April 1975, just five days after the US mission evacuated
          Cambodia.[64]

          The Khmer Rouge reached Phnom Penh and took power in 1975. Led by Pol
          Pot, they changed the official name of the country to Democratic
          Kampuchea. The new regime modelled itself on Maoist China during the
          Great Leap Forward, immediately evacuated the cities, and sent the
          entire population on forced marches to rural work projects. They
          attempted to rebuild the country's agriculture on the model of the
          11th century, discarded Western medicine, and destroyed temples,
          libraries, and anything considered Western.

          Estimates as to how many people were killed by the Khmer Rouge regime
          range from approximately one to three million; the most commonly cited
          figure is two million (about a quarter of the population).[65][66][67]
          This era gave rise to the term Killing Fields, and the prison Tuol
          Sleng became notorious for its history of mass killing. Hundreds of
          thousands fled across the border into neighbouring Thailand. The
          regime disproportionately targeted ethnic minority groups. The Cham
          Muslims suffered serious purges with as much as half of their
          population exterminated.[68] Pol Pot was determined to keep his power
          and disenfranchise any enemies or potential threats, and thus
          increased his violent and aggressive actions against his people.[69]

          Forced repatriation in 1970 and deaths during the Khmer Rouge era
          reduced the Vietnamese population in Cambodia from between 250,000 and
          300,000 in 1969 to a reported 56,000 in 1984.[52] However, most of the
          victims of the Khmer Rouge regime were not ethnic minorities but
          ethnic Khmer. Professionals, such as doctors, lawyers and teachers,
          were also targeted. According to Robert D. Kaplan, "eyeglasses were as
          deadly as the yellow star" as they were seen as a sign of
          intellectualism.[70]

          Religious institutions were targeted by the Khmer Rouge particularly
          fiercely. Religion was so viciously persecuted to such a terrifying
          extent that the vast majority of Cambodia's historic architecture, 95%
          of Cambodia's Buddhist temples, was completely destroyed.[71]

          In November 1978, Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia in response to
          border raids by the Khmer Rouge[72] and conquered it. The People's
          Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) was established as a pro-Soviet state led
          by the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party, a party created by the
          Vietnamese in 1951, and led by a group of Khmer Rouge who had fled
          Cambodia to avoid being purged by Pol Pot and Ta Mok.[73] It was fully
          beholden to the occupying Vietnamese army and under the direction of
          the Vietnamese ambassador to Phnom Penh. Its arms came from Vietnam

          In opposition to the newly created state, a government-in-exile

          was formed in 1981 from three factions.[74] This consisted of the
          Khmer Rouge, a royalist faction led by Sihanouk, and the Khmer
          People's National Liberation Front. Its credentials were recognised by
          the United Nations. The Khmer Rouge representative to the UN, Thiounn
          Prasith, was retained, but he had to work in consultation with
          representatives of the noncommunist Cambodian parties.[75][76] The

          In 1993, the monarchy was restored with Norodom Sihanouk reinstated as
          King, and the first post-war election was coordinated by UNTAC. The
          election was won by FUNCINPEC led by Sihanouk's son Ranariddh in a
          hung parliament. A power-sharing agreement was agreed with Ranariddh
          and Hun Sen of the Cambodian People's Party both simultaneously being
          co-Prime Ministers after the CPP threatened to secede part of the
          country if power was fully transferred to FUNCINPEC. The stability
          established following the conflict was shaken in 1997 by a coup d'état
          led by the co-Prime Minister Hun Sen, who ousted Ranariddh and other
          parties represented in the government and consolidated power for the
          CPP.[79][80] After its government was able to stabilize under Sen,
          Cambodia was accepted into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
          (ASEAN) on 30 April 1999.[81][82] Norodom Sihamoni was crowned

          war crimes and crimes against humanity in his role as the former

          Cambodia has an area of 181,035 square kilometres (69,898 square
          miles) and lies entirely within the tropics, between latitudes 10° and
          15°N, and longitudes 102° and 108°E. It borders Thailand to the north
          and west, Laos to the northeast, and Vietnam to the east and
          southeast. It has a 443-kilometre (275-mile) coastline along the Gulf

        <br />

          Cambodia's landscape is characterised by a low-lying central plain
          that is surrounded by uplands and low mountains and includes the Tonle
          Sap (Great Lake) and the upper reaches of the Mekong River delta.
          Extending outward from this central region are transitional plains,
          thinly forested and rising to elevations of about 650 feet (200
          metres) above sea level.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          To the north the Cambodian plain abuts a sandstone escarpment, which
          forms a southward-facing cliff stretching more than 200 miles (320
          kilometres) from west to east and rising abruptly above the plain to
          heights of 600 to 1,800 feet (180–550 metres). This cliff marks the
          southern limit of the Dângrêk Mountains.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Flowing south through Cambodia's eastern regions is the Mekong River.
          East of the Mekong the transitional plains gradually merge with the
          eastern highlands, a region of forested mountains and high plateaus
          that extend into Laos and Vietnam. In southwestern Cambodia two
          distinct upland blocks, the Krâvanh Mountains and the Dâmrei
          Mountains, form another highland region that covers much of the land
          area between the Tonle Sap and the Gulf of Thailand.

          In this remote and largely uninhabited area, Phnom Aural, Cambodia's
          highest peak rises to an elevation of 5,949 feet (1,813 metres).[103]
          The southern coastal region adjoining the Gulf of Thailand is a narrow
          lowland strip, heavily wooded and sparsely populated, which is
          isolated from the central plain by the southwestern highlands.

          The most distinctive geographical feature is the inundations of the
          Tonle Sap, measuring about 2,590 square kilometres (1,000 square
          miles) during the dry season and expanding to about 24,605 square
          kilometres (9,500 square miles) during the rainy season. This densely
          populated plain, which is devoted to wet rice cultivation, is the
          heartland of Cambodia.[104] Much of this area has been designated as a
          biosphere reserve.[104]

          Cambodia's climate, like that of the rest of Southeast Asia, is
          dominated by monsoons, which are known as tropical wet and dry because
          of the distinctly marked seasonal differences. Cambodia has a
          temperature range from 21 to 35 °C (70 to 95 °F) and experiences
          tropical monsoons. Southwest monsoons blow inland bringing
          moisture-laden winds from the Gulf of Thailand and Indian Ocean from
          May to October. The northeast monsoon ushers in the dry season, which
          lasts from November to April. The country experiences the heaviest
          precipitation from September to October with the driest period
          occurring from January to February.

          According to the International Development Research Center and The
          United Nations, Cambodia is considered Southeast Asia's most
          vulnerable country to the effects of climate change, alongside the
          Philippines.[105][106] Nearly all provinces in Cambodia are affected
          by climate change.[107] Rural coastal populations are particularly at
          risk. Shortages of clean water, extreme flooding, mudslides, higher
          sea levels and potentially destructive storms are of particular
          concern, according to the Cambodia Climate Change Alliance. Climate
          change has also had a major impact on water levels, ecology and
          productivity of the Tonlé Sap in recent years, affecting the food
          security and agriculture of a large proportion of Cambodia's
          population.[108][109]

          Cambodia has two distinct seasons. The rainy season, which runs from
          May to October, can see temperatures drop to 22 °C (72 °F) and is
          generally accompanied with high humidity. The dry season lasts from
          November to April when temperatures can rise up to 40 °C (104 °F)
          around April. Disastrous flooding occurred in 2001 and again in 2002,
          with some degree of flooding almost every year.[110] Severe flooding
          also affected 17 provinces in Cambodia during the 2020 Pacific typhoon
          season.[111]

          The rate of deforestation in Cambodia is one of the highest in the
          world and it is often perceived as the most destructive, singular
          environmental issue in the country.[115] Cambodia's primary forest
          cover fell from over 70% in 1969 to just 3.1% in 2007. Since 2007,
          less than 3,220 km2 (1,243 sq mi) of primary forest remain with the
          result that the future sustainability of the forest reserves of
          Cambodia is under severe threat.[116][117] In 2010–2015, the annual
          rate of deforestation was 1.3%. The environmental degradation also
          includes national parks and wildlife sanctuaries on a large scale and
          many endangered and endemic species are now threatened with extinction
          due to loss of habitats. Reasons for the deforestation in Cambodia
          range from opportunistic illegal loggings to large scale clearings
          from big construction projects and agricultural activities. The
          deforestation involves the local population, Cambodian businesses and
          authorities as well as transnational corporations from all over the
          world.[118][119]

          Plans for hydroelectric development in the Greater Mekong Subregion,
          by Laos in particular, pose a "real danger to the food supply of
          Vietnam and Cambodia. Upstream dams will imperil the fish stocks that
          provide the vast majority of Cambodia's protein and could also denude
          the Mekong River of the silt Vietnam needs for its rice basket." The
          rich fisheries of Tonle Sap, the largest freshwater lake in Southeast
          Asia, largely supply the impoverished country's protein. The lake is
          unusual: It all but disappears in the dry season and then expands
          massively as water flow from the Mekong backs up when the rains come.
          "Those fish are so important for their livelihoods, both economically
          and nutritionally", said Gordon Holtgrieve, a professor at the
          University of Washington; he points out that none of the dams that are
          either built or being built on the Mekong river "are pointing at good
          outcomes for the fisheries".[120]

          National politics in Cambodia take place within the framework of the
          nation's constitution of 1993. The government is a constitutional
          monarchy operated as a parliamentary representative democracy. The
          Prime Minister of Cambodia, currently Hun Manet, is the head of
          government, while the King of Cambodia (currently Norodom Sihamoni) is
          the head of state. The prime minister is appointed by the king, on the
          advice and with the approval of the National Assembly. The prime
          minister and the ministerial appointees exercise executive power.

          Legislative powers are shared by the executive and the bicameral
          Parliament of Cambodia (សភាតំណាងរាស្ត្រ, sâphéa tâmnang réastrâ),
          which consists of a lower house, the National Assembly (រដ្ឋសភា,
          rôdthâsâphéa) and an upper house, the Senate (ព្រឹទ្ធសភា,
          prœ̆tthôsâphéa). Members of the 123-seat National Assembly are elected
          through a system of proportional representation and serve for a
          maximum term of five years. The Senate has 61 seats, two of which are
          appointed by the king and two others by the National Assembly, and the
          rest elected by the commune councillors from the 24 provinces of
          Cambodia. Senators serve six-year terms.[125]

          On 14 October 2004, King Norodom Sihamoni was selected by a special

          quickly put in place after the abdication of King Norodom Sihanouk a
          week prior. Sihamoni's selection was endorsed by Prime Minister Hun
          Sen and National Assembly Speaker Prince Norodom Ranariddh (the king's
          half-brother and current chief advisor), both members of the throne
          council. He was enthroned in Phnom Penh on 29 October 2004.

          Minister Hun Sen, a recast Khmer Rouge official in power since 1985.
          The open doors to new investment during his reign have yielded the
          most access to a coterie of cronies of his and his wife, Bun
          Rany."[attribution needed][126] Cambodia's government has been
          described by Human Rights Watch's Southeast Asian director, David

          Prime Minister Hun Sen vowed to rule until he turned 74.[128][91] His
          government was regularly accused of ignoring human rights and
          suppressing political dissent. The 2013 election results were disputed
          by the opposition, leading to demonstrations in the capital.
          Demonstrators were injured and killed in Phnom Penh where a reported
          20,000 protesters gathered, with some clashing with riot police.[129]
          From a humble farming background, Hun Sen was just 33 when he took
          power in 1985, and was by some considered a long-ruling dictator.[130]
          Hun Sen was succeeded by his son Hun Manet as Prime Minister in August
          2023 following an election that was deemed to be neither free nor
          fair.[5][6][7] Hun Sen remains the de facto ruler of Cambodia through
          his continued leadership of the Cambodian People's Party.[131]

          While the violent ruptures of the 1970s and 1980s have passed, several
          border disputes between Cambodia and its neighbours persist. There are
          disagreements over some offshore islands and sections of the boundary
          with Vietnam and undefined maritime boundaries. Cambodia and Thailand
          also have border disputes, with troops clashing over land immediately
          adjacent to the Preah Vihear temple in particular, leading to a
          deterioration in relations. Most of the territory belongs to Cambodia,
          but a combination of Thailand disrespecting international law, Thai
          troops upbuild in the area and lack of resources for the Cambodian
          military have left the situation unsettled since 1962.[137][138]

          Cambodia and China have cultivated ties in the 2010s. A Chinese
          company with the support of the People's Liberation Army built a
          deep-water seaport along 90 km (56 mi) stretch of Cambodian coastline
          of the Gulf of Thailand in Koh Kong province; the port is sufficiently
          deep to be used by cruise ships, bulk carriers or warships. Cambodia's
          diplomatic support has been invaluable to Beijing's effort to claim
          disputed areas in the South China Sea. Because Cambodia is a member of
          ASEAN, and because under ASEAN rules "the objections of one member can
          thwart any group initiative", Cambodia is diplomatically useful to
          China as a counterweight to southeast Asian nations that have closer
          ties to the United States.[139]

          Hun Sen and his government have seen much controversy. Hun Sen was a
          former Khmer Rouge commander who was originally installed by the
          Vietnamese and, after the Vietnamese left the country, maintains his
          strong man position by violence and oppression when deemed
          necessary.[142] In 1997, fearing the growing power of his co-prime
          minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Hun launched a coup, using the
          army to purge Ranariddh and his supporters. Ranariddh was ousted and
          fled to Paris while other opponents of Hun Sen were arrested,

          The level of corruption in Cambodia exceeds most countries in the
          world. Despite adopting an 'Anti-Corruption Law' in 2010, corruption
          prevails throughout the country. Corruption affects the judiciary, the
          police, and other state institutions. Favouritism by government
          officials and impunity is commonplace. Lack of a clear distinction
          between the courts and the executive branch of government also makes
          for a deep politicisation of the judicial system.[152]
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Examples of areas where Cambodians encounter corrupt practices in
          their everyday lives include obtaining medical services, dealing with
          alleged traffic violations, and pursuing fair court verdicts.
          Companies deal with extensive red tape when obtaining licenses and
          permits, especially construction-related permits, and the demand for
          and supply of bribes are commonplace in this process. The 2010
          Anti-Corruption Law provided no protection to whistle-blowers, and
          whistle-blowers can be jailed for up to 6 months if they report

          The Cambodian legal profession was established in 1932. By 1978, due
          to the Khmer Rouge regime, the entire legal system was eradicated.
          Judges and lawyers were executed after being deemed "class enemies"
          and only 6–12 legal professionals actually survived and remained in
          the country.[153] Lawyers did not reappear until 1995 when the Bar
          Association of the Kingdom of Cambodia was created.[154][155]

          has been significant aid from bilateral and multilateral donors.

          arrivals in 2018 topped six million, a ten-fold increase since the
          beginning of the 21st century.[178] Tourism employs 26% of the

          investment in renewable energy by 2020, the country serves as a model
          to learn from for other ASEAN countries in terms of conducting solar
          power auctions.[203] To attract more investment in renewable energy,
          the government could improve renewable energy governance, adopt clear
          targets, develop an effective regulatory framework, improve project
          bankability and facilitate market entry for international
          investors.[203] Cambodia is highly vulnerable to the negative effects
          of climate change and it is advised that the country focuses more on
          developing renewable energy as part of climate change mitigation
          measures.[204]

          The first official census conducted by the French protectorate of
          Cambodia was in 1921; however, only men aged 20 to 60 were counted as
          its purpose was for the collection of taxes.[205] After the 1962
          population census was conducted, Cambodia's civil conflicts and
          instability lead to a 36-year-long gap before the country could have
          another official census in 1998.[206]

          At present, fifty per cent of the Cambodian population is younger than
          22 years old. At a 1.04 female to male ratio, Cambodia has the most
          female-biased sex ratio in the Greater Mekong Subregion.[207] Among
          the Cambodian population aged over 65, the female to male ratio is

          The vast majority of Cambodia's population is of ethnic Khmer origin
          (over 95%) who are speakers of the Khmer language, the country's sole
          official language. Cambodia's population is largely homogeneous. Its
          minority groups include Chams (1.2%), Vietnamese (0.1%) and Chinese
          (0.1%).[84]

        <p>
          The largest ethnic group in Cambodia are the Khmers, who comprise
          around 90% of the total population in Cambodia, and are indigenous to
          the lowland Mekong subregion in which they inhabit. The Khmers
          historically have lived near the lower Mekong River in a contiguous
          diagonal arc, from where modern-day Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia meet
          in the northwest, all the way to the mouth of the Mekong River in
          southeastern Vietnam.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Vietnamese are the second-largest ethnic minority in Cambodia,
          with an estimated 16,000 living in provinces concentrated in the
          southeast of the country adjacent to the Mekong Delta. Although the
          Vietnamese language has been determined to be a Mon–Khmer language,
          there are very few cultural connections between the two peoples
          because the early Khmers were influenced by the Indian cultural sphere
          while the Vietnamese are part of the Chinese cultural sphere.[210]
          Ethnic tensions between the Khmer and the Vietnamese can be traced to
          the Post-Angkor Period (from the 16th to 19th centuries), during which
          time a nascent Vietnam and Thailand each attempted to vassalise a
          weakened post-Angkor Cambodia, and effectively dominate all of
          Indochina.[210]

          Chinese Cambodians are approximately 0.1% of the population.[211][212]
          Most Chinese are descended from 19th–20th-century settlers who came in
          search of trade and commerce opportunities during the time of the
          French protectorate. Most are urban dwellers, engaged primarily in
          commerce.

          The indigenous ethnic groups of the mountains are known collectively
          as Montagnards or Khmer Loeu, a term meaning "Highland Khmer". They
          are descended from neolithic migrations of Mon–Khmer speakers via
          southern China and Austronesian speakers from insular Southeast Asia.
          Being isolated in the highlands, the various Khmer Loeu groups were
          not Indianized like their Khmer cousins and consequently are
          culturally distant from modern Khmers and often from each other,
          observing many pre-Indian-contact customs and beliefs.

          The Cham are descended from the Austronesian people of Champa, a

          Vietnam and former rival to the Khmer Empire. The Cham in Cambodia
          number under a million and often maintain separate villages in the
          southeast of the country. Almost all Cham in Cambodia are Muslims.

          The Khmer language is a member of the Mon–Khmer subfamily of the
          Austroasiatic language group. French, once the language of government
          in Indochina, is still spoken by many older Cambodians, and is also
          the language of instruction in some schools and universities that are
          funded by the government of France. There is also a French-language
          newspaper and some TV channels are available in French. Cambodia is a
          member of La Francophonie. Cambodian French, a remnant of the
          country's colonial past, is a dialect found in Cambodia and is
          sometimes used in government, particularly in court. Since 1993, there
          has been a growing use of English, which has been replacing French as
          the main foreign language. English is widely taught in several
          universities and there is also a significant press in that language,
          while street signs are now bilingual in Khmer and English.[214] Due to
          this shift, mostly English is now used in Cambodia's international
          relationships, and it has replaced French both on Cambodia's stamps
          and, since 2002, on Cambodian currency.[215]

          Theravada Buddhism is the official religion of Cambodia, practised by
          more than 95 per cent of the population with an estimated 4,392
          monastery temples throughout the country.[216] Cambodian Buddhism is
          deeply influenced by Hinduism and native animism.

          The close interrelationship between spirits and the community, the
          efficacy of apotropaic and luck-attracting actions and charms, and the
          possibility of manipulating one's life through contact with spiritual
          entities such as the "baromey" spirits originates from the native folk
          religion. Hinduism has left little trace beyond the magical practices
          of Tantricism and a host of Hindu gods now assimilated into the spirit
          world (for example, the important neak ta spirit called Yeay Mao is
          the modern avatar of the Hindu goddess Kali).

          Cambodia was once one of the most landmined countries in the world.
          According to some estimates, unexploded land mines have been
          responsible for over 60,000 civilian deaths and thousands more maimed
          or injured since 1970.[223] The number of reported landmine casualties
          has sharply decreased, from 800 in 2005 to 111 in 2013 (22 dead and 89
          injured).[224] Adults that survive landmines often require amputation
          of one or more limbs and have to resort to begging for survival.[223]
          Cambodia is expected to be free of land mines by 2025[225] but the
          social and economic legacy, including orphans and one in 290 people
          being an amputee,[226] is expected to affect Cambodia for years to

          The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports is responsible for
          establishing national policies and guidelines for education in
          Cambodia. The Cambodian education system is heavily decentralised,
          with three levels of government, central, provincial, and district –
          responsible for its management. The constitution of Cambodia
          promulgates free compulsory education for nine years, guaranteeing the

          The education system in Cambodia continues to face many challenges,

          especially in terms of primary net enrolment gains, the introduction
          of program based-budgeting, and the development of a policy framework
          which helps disadvantaged children to gain access to education. The
          country has also significantly invested in vocational education,
          especially in rural areas, to tackle poverty and unemployment.

          Traditionally, education in Cambodia was offered by the wats (Buddhist
          temples), thus providing education exclusively for the male
          population.[231] During the Khmer Rouge regime, education suffered
          significant setbacks. Education has also suffered setbacks from child
          labour, A study by Kim (2011) reports that most employed children in
          Cambodia are enrolled in school but their employment is associated
          with late school entry, negative impacts on their learning outcomes,
          and increased drop out rates.[232] With respect to academic
          performance among Cambodian primary school children, research showed

          beef balls, shrimp, pork liver or lettuce. Kampot pepper is reputed to
          be the best in the world and accompanies crab at the Kep crab shacks
          and squid in the restaurants on the Ou Trojak Jet river.[242] The
          cuisine is relatively unknown to the world compared to that of its
          neighbours Thailand and Vietnam.

          Cambodians drink plenty of tea, grown in Mondulkiri Province and
          around Kirirom.[243] te krolap is a strong tea, made by putting water
          and a mass of tea leaves into a small glass, placing a saucer on top,
          and turning the whole thing upside down to brew. When it is dark
          enough, the tea is decanted into another cup and plenty of sugar
          added, but no milk. Lemon tea te kdau kroch chhma, made with Chinese
          red-dust tea and lemon juice, is refreshing both hot and iced and is
          generally served with a hefty dose of sugar.[244] Regarding coffee,
          the beans are generally imported from Laos and Vietnam – although
          domestically produced coffee from Ratanakiri Province and Mondulkiri
          Province can be found in some places. Beans are traditionally roasted
          with butter and sugar, plus various other ingredients that might
          include anything from rum to pork fat, giving the beverage a strange,
          sometimes faintly chocolatey aroma.[244]

          Cambodia has several industrial breweries, located mainly in
          Sihanoukville Province and Phnom Penh. There are also a growing number
          of microbreweries in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap.[245][246] As of 2019,
          there are 12 brewpubs or microbreweries in Cambodia.[247] Rice wine is
          a popular alcoholic drink. Its quality varies widely and it is often
          infused with fruits or medicinal herbs.[248] When prepared with
          macerated fruits or spices, like the Sombai liqueur, it is called sra
          tram (soaked wine).[249][250][251]

          Football (soccer) is one of the most popular sports, although
          professional organised sports are not as prevalent in Cambodia as in
          western countries because of the economic conditions. Soccer was
          brought to Cambodia by the French and became popular with the
          locals.[252] The Cambodia national football team managed fourth in the
          1972 Asian Cup, but development has slowed since the civil war.

          Western sports such as basketball, volleyball, bodybuilding, field
          hockey, rugby union, golf, and baseball are gaining popularity.
          Volleyball is by far the most popular sport in the country[citation
          needed]. Native sports include traditional boat racing, buffalo
          racing, Pradal Serey, Khmer traditional wrestling and Bokator.
          Cambodia first participated in the Olympics during the 1956 Summer
          Olympic Games sending equestrian riders. Cambodia also hosted the

          Cambodian dance can be divided into three main categories: Khmer
          classical dance, folk dance, and social dances. The exact origins of
          Khmer classical dance are disputed. Most native Khmer scholars trace
          modern dance forms back to the time of Angkor, seeing similarities in
          the temple engravings of the period, while others hold that modern
          Khmer dance styles were learned (or re-learned) from Siamese court
          dancers in the 1800s.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Khmer classical dance is the form of stylised performance art
          established in the royal courts of Cambodia exhibited for both
          entertainment and ceremonial purposes.[253] The dances are performed
          by intricately costumed, highly trained men and women on public
          occasions for tribute, invocation or to enact traditional stories and
          epic poems such as Reamker, the Khmer version of the Ramayana.[254]
          Known formally as Robam Preah Reach Troap (របាំព្រះរាជទ្រព្យ "theater
          of royal wealth") it is set to the music of a pinpeat ensemble
          accompanied by a vocal chorus.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Cambodian folk dance, often performed to mahori music, celebrates the
          various cultural and ethnic groups of Cambodia. Folk dances originated
          in the villages and are performed, for the most part, by the villagers
          for the villagers.[255] The movements are less stylised and the
          clothing worn is that of the people the dancers are portraying, such
          as hill tribes, Chams or farmers. Typically faster-paced than
          classical dance, folk dances display themes of the "common person"
          such as love, comedy or warding off evil spirits.[255]
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Social dances are those performed by guests at banquets, parties or
          other informal social gatherings. Khmer traditional social dances are
          analogous to those of other Southeast Asian nations. Examples include
          the circle dances Romvong and Romkbach as well as Saravan and Lam
          Leav. Modern western popular dances including Cha-cha, Bolero, and the
          Madison, have also influenced Cambodian social dance.

          Traditional Cambodian music dates back as far as the Khmer
          Empire.[258] Royal dances like the Apsara Dance are icons of the
          Cambodian culture as are the Mahori ensembles that accompany them.
          More rural forms of music include Chapei and Ayai. The former is
          popular among the older generation and is most often a solo
          performance of a man plucking a Cambodian guitar (chapei) in between a
          cappella verses. The lyrics usually have moral or religious theme.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A Yai can be performed solo or by a man and woman and is often comedic
          in nature. It is a form of lyrical poetry, often full of double
          entendres, that can be either scripted or completely impromptu and
          ad-libbed. When sung by a duo, the man and women take turns,
          "answering" the other's verse or posing riddles for the other to
          solve, with short instrumental breaks in between verses. Pleng kaah
          (lit. "wedding music") is a set of traditional music and songs played
          both for entertainment and as accompaniment for the various ceremonial
          parts of a traditional, days-long Khmer wedding.

          Cambodian popular music is performed with western style instruments or
          a mixture of traditional and western instruments. Dance music is
          composed in particular styles for social dances. The music of crooner
          Sinn Sisamouth, Ros Sereysothea, and Pen Ran from the 1960s to the
          1970s is considered to be the classic pop music of Cambodia. During
          the Khmer Rouge Revolution, many classic and popular singers of the
          1960s and 1970s were murdered, starved to death, or overwork to death
          by the Khmer Rouge.[259] and many original master tapes from the
          period were lost or destroyed.

          In the 1980s, Keo Surath, (a refugee resettled in the United States)
          and others carried on the legacy of the classic singers, often
          remaking their popular songs. The 1980s and 1990s also saw the rise in
          popularity of kantrum, a music style of the Khmer Surin set to modern
          instrumentation.[260]

          The Dengue Fever rock and roll band features a Cambodian female singer
